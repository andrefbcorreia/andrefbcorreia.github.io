        Born in Switzerland, lived most of my life in the shiny south of Portugal 
        and currently working in Lisbon. Took <span>Computer Science</span> in 
        <span> FCT NOVA Lisboa</span>, where I develop my knowledge base and passion for building beautiful and 
        functional web applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been mainly working as a <span>full stack</span> developer with technologies such as <span>React JS</span>, 
        <span> Node JS</span> and <span>Ruby on Rails</span> in projects that involve a large codebase, 
        unit tests and code reviews.
